# SnapQuest

SnapQuest offers our users a daily "Quest" target to take a picture of. An example of a quest may be something like "take a picture of cherry blossoms,". The targets are carefully crafted to get our users to take a stroll and enjoy nature, promoting staying active and and taking a moment to breathe.

The photos taken by our users are passed along to Google Cloud Vision to be analyzed, which we use to judge if the user submission fulfills the quest. When the user completes their quest for the day, their streak is maintained and they get points that they can use to redeem discount codes from our company sponsors.

The rewards are refreshed by seasons. These seasonal updates not only keep the rewards relevant and enticing for our users but also provide sponsoring companies with the perfect opportunity to target their marketing efforts effectively.


Wellness isn't necessarily about making big changes or engaging in intense activities. It can start with simple adjustments in our daily routines, such as taking a leisurely walk outdoors to enjoy fresh air. This small step can have significant benefits for both our mental and physical well-being.
Venturing outside and immersing ourselves in nature can be incredibly revitalizing. The natural environment provides a tranquil setting that helps us relax and reduce stress. Taking a break from the usual hustle and bustle allows our minds to unwind and approach challenges with greater clarity.
Beyond the physical benefits, connecting with nature can foster a sense of well-being and gratitude. It reminds us of our connection to the world around us and instills feelings of awe and appreciation. This connection will link to better mental health and increased resilience.


By introducing seasonal coupons with varying behenefits, where users can buy coupons for specific amounts and stack them, we can create a dynamic and engaging experience for customers. Users will be more motivate to save up their rewards by completing activities, leading to increasing engagement/activity and welllness as well as potentiall higher spending over time.
